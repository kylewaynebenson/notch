# Notch Font Family

Notch is a set of cut-in style OpenType fonts designed for a introductory [Skillshare class](http://skl.sh/1CuoDpS) on how to design a display font.

## Usage

See the [license](https://github.com/kylewaynebenson/notch/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for exact details. To put it simply, this font family was built so that others can see and inspect it for educational purposes but the license doesn't limit you to educational uses.

##Getting Involved

Fork this repository, or email me at [help@kylewaynebenson.com](mailto:help@kylewaynebenson.com) if you'd like to become a regular contributor. I'd love help building this family out with more weights, widths, and a serif version.
