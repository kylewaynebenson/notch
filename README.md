# Notch Font Family

Notch is a set of cut-in style OpenType fonts designed for a Skillshare class on learning how to design a basic display font.

## Usage

See the license for more details. To put it simply, I'm open source licensing this font so that others can see and inspect the masters for educational purposes. But the license doesn't limit you to educational uses. Go wild.
